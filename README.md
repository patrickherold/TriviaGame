# TriviaGame
## A little trivia game for fun.

This game features two sliders. 

One to **adjust the amount of time** to answer each question.
The other selects **how many questions** in each game. 

*This should help the TA play a few games quickly* **:-)**

After each game, the **number of questions will increase** and the amount of **time per question will decrease**. So buckle up and get ready for some exciting trivia.

The trivia questions come from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/)
